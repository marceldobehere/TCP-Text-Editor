# TCP-Text-Editor
A Console Text Editor where you can code together with other people

## Note
This is very WIP.

A lot of stuff is bad and not implemented yet lmao.


But I am working on it.

Just wanted to share the code for now.


## Controls
Arrow keys - Move Cursor
Backspace - Remove Char
Enter - New Line (not implemented)

Esc - Enter command


## Command

### login
Logs in as a user.

### file
Opens a file.


## How to run
Change the folder path in the servee project (bc I am too lazy rn)
Build the project.
Open the Server EXE in the server bin folder.
Open the Client EXE in the client bin folder.


Now you'll have to login and open a file.
